### Debugging Maven Plugin Warnings
To trace the source of Maven plugin warnings (such as deprecated configurations), you can inspect the 
**effective POM** â€” which shows the final configuration after inheritance and profile merging.
To track down any Maven plugin warnings/issues, run the following command and search for the warning/issue.
```shell
./mvn help:effective-pom
```
Then search the output for the warning or configuration you're investigating (e.g., `systemProperties`, 
plugin versions, inherited settings, etc.).
